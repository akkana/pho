I hope you enjoy pho, the lightweight image viewer!

More information on pho, and the latest version, is available at:
http://www.shallowsky.com/software/pho/

See the man page or the web page for more details on how to use pho.

WARNING: Pho uses the GTK2 toolkit, which is obsolete. I have not been
successful in rewriting Pho to use either GTK3 or GTK4, due to
apparently removed functionality and poor documentation.

As of mid-2025, GTK2 is still available for most platforms. But if it
becomes unavailable, I have been working on a replacement written in
Python using TkInter instead of GTK. If you want to help test, it's
currently available as tkpho in my metapho repository (and I've also
rewritten metapho to use Tk instead of GTK).
Please file issue reports on any problems you find.
