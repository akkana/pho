<h1>pho: View and annotate multiple images</h1>

<i><a href="../../mailme.html">...Akkana</a></i>

<p>
<b>pho</b> is a lightweight program for viewing large numbers of
images quickly, rotating or deleting some,
and making notes about what to do with each image --
for instance, for going through hundreds of
images after uploading them from a digital camera.

<p><b>Pho 0.9.6 is nigh! Please test 0.9.6-pre1!</b>

<p><a href="#download">Skip to the download section.</a>

<p>
The big change here is Keywords mode. It uses the same note flags
that Pho has always had, but Keywords mode gives you an easy way to
annotate a directory of images with strings. You can type in phrases
for each note, and you can have up to 31 notes now, not just 10.
If you use Pho to categorize your photos, you'll like Keywords mode.

<p>
There's also a new slideshow mode, where you specify the interval in seconds
(e.g. pho -p -s5 for a 5-second delay between images).
You can use this for a screensaver, or just to go through slides
automatically. Hitting the spacebar cancels slideshow mode.

<p>
You can now customize the command called up with the 'g' key:
it still defaults to gimp-remote, but you can call a different
program, e.g. view the current image in firefox with
<code>export PHO_CMD="firefox %s"</code> --
don't forget the %s for the filename!

<p>
Other changes include major work on scaling modes. Double and half size
mode now behave differently depending on whether you're in normal or
full size mode, and the scaling factor (e.g. half size) is remembered
as you go from image to image.

<p>
<b>Warning: I've swapped the meanings of f and F. I found that I
use full size mode all the time, whereas I seldom use full screen,
and when I do, I use it once at the beginning of a session (e.g.
to view a bunch of cartoons scaled up). So it makes more sense
to have full size on f (easier to type).</b>

<p>
I've also done quite a bit of performance work, to reduce the number
of redraws, speed up rotates, and reduce the number of times Pho has to
re-read the file on disk.

<h2>Why another image viewer?  Surely there are plenty of those?</h2>

<p>
I used to use xv for paging through images -- it's quite a good
viewing program -- but it had a few features which annoyed me.  For
example, it creates a directory called .xvpics in every directory it touches;
and if an image has to be resized to fit the screen, and after that
you save it (perhaps after rotating it), it saves at the smaller size
and boom, there goes your high-res image.

<p>
But, more important, there were a few extra things I needed.
During image triage, I need to be able to do a few things quickly:
<ul>
<li>Rotate images by multiples of 90 degrees, and remember the rotations.
<li>Delete bad images.
<li>Copy a few of the best horizontals to my Backgrounds (wallpaper) directory.
<li>Note which images I might want to put on a web page (after resizing).
</ul>
With xv, I found that I was writing these lists on paper, or trying
to keep track of them in my head.  That's dumb!  Why not make the
computer do that work?  So I did.

<p>
Since I wrote pho several years ago, I keep hearing about other
image viewers, and thinking maybe pho was redundant.  But I recently
did a search, and couldn't come up with any other image viewers that
are similarly efficient for paging through large collections of
images.  So I guess I'll keep maintaining pho!

<p>
Pho can read any format supported by gdk-pixbuf.  I haven't found a
list of those formats anywhere, but it seems to be substantial.
The only format I've hit so far that it doesn't read is photocd.
You can convert those to other formats using the ImageMagick utility.

<p>
Pho can delete images on disk, but it can't save rotated
images yet.
I use my <a href="../imagebatch/">imagebatch</a> scripts for that.

<h2>How to use pho</h2>

Usage: pho *.jpg (or whatever).<br>
It will show the first image, scaled for your screen if needed.
Then the following keys work:
<dl>
<dt>space                   <dd>Go to next image.
<dt>backspace, -            <dd>Go to previous image.
<dt>r, t, right-arrow       <dd>Rotate right (clockwise). 
<dt>R, T, l, L, left-arrow  <dd>Rotate left (counter-clockwise).
<dt>up-arrow                <dd>Rotate 180 degrees.
<dt>home                    <dd>Go back to the first image.
<dt>d                 <dd>Bring up a delete dialog (another d deletes the file)
<dt>i                       <dd>Show information about the image
                                (includes EXIF info and JPEG comment, if any).
<dt>0-9                     <dd>Add this image to the appropriate list.
<dt>f                       <dd>Toggle in and out of "full size mode"
      (show the image at its native size, even if that's too big
       to fit on screen)
<dt>F                       <dd>Toggle in and out of "full screen mode"
      (make the image as big as it can be and still fit on the screen).
<dt>p                       <dd>Toggle in and out of Presentation Mode
      (full screen, no mouse or window borders)
<dt>-, /                    <dd>Zoom out, to half size
<dt>+, =, *                 <dd>Zoom in, to double size
<dt>g                       <dd>Run gimp-remote on this image
    (or set PHO_REMOTE to an alternate command).
<dt>q                       <dd>Quit.
</dl>

pho will remember the correct (last shown) rotation for each image.
When it exits (either because the last image was viewed or because
the user typed q), it will print out the images that need to be
rotated and deleted (it does not actually change the files on disk),
and the images which were added to numbered lists.
For example, I might press 1 on all the photos I want to save for
a web page, 2 on the couple of photos that need additional editing
in gimp, and 3 on the photos I want to save as desktop backgrounds.

<h2>Getting pho</h2>
<p>
<p>
Try the new pho 0.9.6 pre1! I expect to release Pho 0.9.6 very soon.

(This is labelled 0.9.5-pre5, but there have been no changes
between pre5 and the final 0.9.5. No 0.9.5.1 yet.)

<p>
<i>Dependencies:</i>
pho uses the gtk+ libraries, including gdk-pixbuf.
You may need to edit the Makefile if your system has these libraries
installed in different place from my system (sorry, no autoconf yet).
Also included is a little xlib program, xpho, which is mostly
interesting as an example of how to use gdk_pixbuf_xlib.
<p>
To compile pho, you'll need a compiler, GTK, and all the libraries
it depends on. For example, on Ubuntu Feisty, this command should get you
what you need:
<pre>
aptitude install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev
</pre>

<p>
Pho does work on Mac OS X, as an X application
if you have the appropriate gtk/gdk headers and libraries.

<p>
If you like pho, or if you think it's promising but there's some
feature it really needs ... <a href="../../mailme.html">let me know!</a>
