	minor documentation updates.

7/9/2016, pho 1.0pre1
	Add middlemouse dragging in presentation mode.

9/5/2012, pho-0.9.8
	Finally! An actual release!

4/10/2012, Pho 0.9.7-pre8
	Add captions/image comments (from David <somloieater@gmail.com>) with -c.
	Improve scaling up from keywords mode (but some scaling issues remain).
	More aspect ratio fixing and code cleanup.

4/17/2011, Pho 0.9.7-pre7
	Fix aspect ratio of fullsize mode on vertical images;
	increase keyword dialog height, and add some keyword dialog
	reliability fixes; fix build warnings reported on Irix.

11/26/2010, Pho 0.9.7-pre6:
	Much more reliable scaling code -- this (I hope) fixes the
	problems with aspect ratio upon rotation.
	New PHO_SCALE_FIXED mode: keep image's larger dimension <= the given
	size (stored confusingly in gScaleRatio).
	Use PHO_SCALE_FIXED and .75 times the shorter dimension of the 
	screen for Keywords mode.
	Alt+num toggles 10+num flag.

4/10/2010, Pho 0.9.7-pre5:
	Fix a slew of subtle bugs involving going back and forward im the
	image list (e.g. when specifying nonexistent images). Add some
	information on how to test for regressions.

2/9/2009, Pho 0.9.7-pre4:
	Add ToggleBetween to better manage transitions between various modes
	and make sure proper scaling and redraw happens.

12/15/2009, Pho 0.9.7-pre3:
	More cleanup of rotation/scaling, and transitions from one mode
	to the next.

9/26/2009, Pho 0.9.7-pre2:
	Add ability to add new image files or change the list without restarting.
	Total cleanup/rewrite of rotate/scale logic.
	Remove old gtk1 code.

N/N/2009, Pho 0.9.7-pre1:

	smarter PHO_CMD (can do other things, not just GIMP);
	don't go fullscreen from Ctrl-F in the keywords dialog.
	fix a minor Mac build issue.

11/9/2008, Pho 0.9.6:
	RELEASE! The only difference from 0.9.6-pre3 is to change
	the default PHO_CMD command from gimp-remote to gimp,
	since gimp-remote is obsolete and no longer provided in Linux
	distros (and never was, on Mac or Win).

10/2/2008, Pho 0.9.6-pre3:
	Change the list next/prev code to fix (I hope) a bug where pho
	would get confused and cycle from the last image back to the first.

8/13/2008, Pho 0.9.6-pre2:
	Simplify exif/Makefile so it'll work on FreeBSD and other
	systems where make is non-GNU make

N/N/2007, Pho 0.9.6-pre1:
	Add new Keywords mode and keywords dialog.
	Add stay-on-top code for prompt and keywords dialogs.
	Clean up a lot of spurious expose events that gtk was sending,
	in the hopes of curing the double-draws visible on slow machines.
	(There are still some a few left, from resize events.)
	A few minor fixes to work better with xinerama.

8/6/2007, Pho 0.9.5.1:
	Fix a buffer overflow bug on the 'g' (gimp-remote) key.

	No changes from pre5 except some manual and html page updates.

3/5/2007, Pho 0.9.5-pre5:
	Check for a PHO_ARGS environment variable. Add a -P argument to force non-presentation mode. Fix a few bugs with double/half size and with scaling.
	Make note 0 work properly. 

7/24/2005, Pho 0.9.5-pre4:
	Double and half size weren't working properly;
	couldn't use arrow and spacebar to get out of the final Quit confirmation dialog (though ESC always worked). 

10/9/2004, Pho 0.9.5-pre3:
	Fixed a crash bug when revisiting an image which was previously rotated.
	Added a workaround for Metacity's evil window size handling.
	Made the background black when in presentation mode. 

9/30/2004, Pho 0.9.5-pre2:
	Fixed some bugs involving ending up at the wrong image when deleting or pressing HOME. Cleaned up handing of image list.
	Fixed an aspect ratio problem. 

7/13/2004, Pho 0.9.5-pre1:

	Also fix a crash after dismissing the info dialog by clicking on the windowmanager "X". 

2/26/2003, Pho 0.9.1:
	Rusty Russell: fix an off-by-one error in rotation code, reducing the need for extra memory;
	Brian Langenberger: bracket printed filenames with quotes if they contain spaces or quote characters.

	Fix pho.spec version, and a make clean bug.
