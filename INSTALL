BUILDING AND INSTALLING pho

REQUIREMENTS:
pho uses the gdk_pixbuf library for reading, scaling, and displaying
images. So you will need gdk-pixbuf installed in order to run pho.
To compile it, you will also need gdk-pixbuf-devel.
The home for gdk_pixbuf is:
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gdk-pixbuf/index.html

BUILDING:
To build pho, type: make
To install the binary and manual page, type (as root): make install

(BSD users: the pho Makefiles assume that "make" is GNU make.
If your make is actually BSD make, you'll need to type gmake,
and edit the Makefile to change (cd exif; make) to use gmake instead.)

Make will build two binaries: in addition to pho (a gtk app),
xpho is the first and simplest version of pho, which uses only
xlib to display, and can't put up any dialogs.
xpho is not installed by make install.
It is included here primarily as an example of how to use
gdk_pixbuf_xlib, which comes in handy now and then.

The current Makefile has been tested on Redhat 7.3 and Debian Woody,
and assumes gtk 1.2 (and gtk-devel) as well as gdk-pixbuf 1.0.
You may need to edit the Makefile on some other systems,
or to use other versions of gtk.
Sorry, there is no configure script for it yet.
Feel free to contact me if you have any problems building pho.
