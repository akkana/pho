BUILDING AND INSTALLING pho

REQUIREMENTS:

Pho uses GTK+ 2. This is quite an old library (writing this in 2023)
and may eventually stop being supported. I've tried to port Pho to GTK 3,
but some of the lower-level calls pho uses have no GTK3 equivalent that
I've been able to find. When GTK2 stopps being shipped by Linux distros,
C-based pho will probably become an orphan. Since I use pho all the time,
many times a day, I will write something to replace it; probably a somewhat
simpler Python-based program, without the low-level window management (like
keeping the pointer in the window), but with the same key bindings.

Pho uses the gdk_pixbuf library for reading, scaling, and displaying
images. So you will need gdk-pixbuf installed in order to run pho.
To compile it, you will also need gdk-pixbuf-devel, or whatever package
on your system provides include files like gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h.

BUILDING:
To build pho, type: make
To install the binary and manual page, type (as root): make install
or simply copy the binary wherever you want to put it (I use ~/bin).

The current Makefile works on modern Debian derivatives.
You may need to edit the Makefile on some other systems,
or to use other versions of gtk.
Sorry, there is no configure script for it.
Feel free to contact me if you have any problems building pho.
